## forms ##
- An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

* There are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site:
- Adding Text
- Makking choices
- submiting forms

## How Forms Work? ##
- A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.
- The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.
- The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database.
- The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.

## forms structure ## 
- < form > :This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.
- action: Every < form > element requires an action attribute.
- method: Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
