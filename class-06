* ## WHAT IS AN OBJECT? ##
- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world.

* ## In JavaScript: ##
• Variables have a name and you can assign them a value of a string, number, or Boolean.
• Arrays have a name and a group of values. (Each item in an array is a name/value pair because it has an index number and a value.)
• Named functions have a name and value that is a set of statements to run if the function is called.
• Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs (but the names are referred to as keys).

* ## Document object models ##
- The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
> When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

- The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

 - With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

* JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
* JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
* JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
* JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
* JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page
