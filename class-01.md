 ### HTML layout ## 
 > HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page.
 
 ### How we use HTML tags to create our layout? ###
 
 #### Header,footer,nav,article,aside,section,hgroup and div ####
 
 - The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
 - A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.
 - The < nav > element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
 - The < article > element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
 - The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.
   * When the <aside> element is used inside an <article> element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. 
   * When the <aside> element is used outside of an <article> element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.
 - The < section > element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
 - The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more < h1 > through < h6 > elements so that they are treated as one single heading.
 - The < div > tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
