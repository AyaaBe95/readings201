## Error jandling and debugging ## 

- Debugging is a process for testing, finding the errors and reducing them from happening in future
- JzavaScripts has 7 different types of errors.each creates its own object,which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.
- The JavaScript console will tell you when there is a problem with a script, where to look for the problem, and what kind of issue it seems to be.

## How to find the source of error? ##
- if a JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an exception. At that point, the interpreter stops and looks for exception-handling code.
- Error objects can help you find where your mistakes are and browsers have tools to help you read them.

## HOW TO DEAL WITH ERRORS ##
- DEBUG THE SCRIPT TO FIX ERRORS
- HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY
