## Lists ##
 HTML provides us with three different types:
 - Ordered lists
    * The ordered list is created with the < ol > element.
 - Unordered lists 
    * The unordered list is created with the < ul > element.
 - Definition lists
    * The definition list is created with the < dl > element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
    
 > we can put a second list inside an < li > element to create a sublist or nested list.
 
## Boxes ##
- All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
- The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

### Why we use boxes elements? ###
- border-width:it controls the width of a border.
- border-style:it controls the style of a border using the border-style property.
- border-color: it specifies the color of a border using either RGB values, hex codes or CSS color names.
- padding:it specifies how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.
- margin:it controls the gap between boxes.
