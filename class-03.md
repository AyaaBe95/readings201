# Class-03 reading Notes #

## Lists ##
 HTML provides us with three different types:
 - Ordered lists
    * The ordered list is created with the < ol > element.
 - Unordered lists 
    * The unordered list is created with the < ul > element.
 - Definition lists
    * The definition list is created with the < dl > element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
    
 > we can put a second list inside an < li > element to create a sublist or nested list.
 
## Boxes ##
- All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
- The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

### Why we use boxes elements? ###
- border-width:it controls the width of a border.
- border-style:it controls the style of a border using the border-style property.
- border-color: it specifies the color of a border using either RGB values, hex codes or CSS color names.
- padding:it specifies how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.
- margin:it controls the gap between boxes.

## Decisions and Loops ##

* ### If statement ###
  - Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.
  - Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

* ### Switch statement ###
  - The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
  - Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

  * #### How it works? ####
   - The switch expression is evaluated once.
   - The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
   - If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
   - If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
