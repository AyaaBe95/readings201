## Lists ##
 HTML provides us with three different types:
 - Ordered lists
    * The ordered list is created with the < ol > element.
 - Unordered lists 
    * The unordered list is created with the < ul > element.
 - Definition lists
    * The definition list is created with the < dl > element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
    
 > we can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.
