# Class 12 canvas Element and Chart.js #

## Canvas ##
- The HTML < canvas > element is used to draw graphics on a web page.
- A canvas is a rectangular area on an HTML page. By default, a canvas has no border and no content.
- After creating the rectangular canvas area, you must add a JavaScript to do the drawing.
- Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

## Charts ##
- Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables.
-  the script is included in HTML page along with a single < canvas > node to render the chart.

## Setting up charts ##
-  download Chart.js.
- create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw the chart
