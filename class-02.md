* # CSS #
-  CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document and it describes how HTML elements should be displayed. 

## How css works? ##
- CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
 * Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to.
 * Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. 
 
 ## How we declarate css ? ##
 - CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon.
